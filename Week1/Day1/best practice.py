#variable best practice

#naming a variable in python

year_1994= 35

# 1994_year = not allowed
# $ or @alo = not allowed

_my_variable = "something"

#works, but we try to avoid because is interferring with OOP

#PASSWORD = "1234" allowed, but we use for constant values

#multiple words = underscore instead of space

my_score = 100
